assignment 7
due in two weeks
next week: the first test during the lab

classes! + read / write to file
console based application
1 add
2 display
3 filter
4 undo

classes:
UI
has as an attribute a service object
|
V
Service -> functions for each functionality (add, filter, undo, get_all)
the service uses repository, whenever needed, ie add: creates the domain object, uses add from repo
|
V
Repository -> manages the list of elements (add, remove, search an element, return all elements)
manages read / write to file
|
V
Domain -> get, set, create, to_string (how we manage our entities)

for testing we can use functions, not necessarily classes

repository:
we need to implement three different types of repositories
    - in memory repo -> no files, just keeps the list in memory
    - text file -> .txt just put data in text file
    - binary file -> .pickle/ copies the list represented in memory and puts it into the file, we have to use the pickle package

how we choose which one to use:

start.py
create objects for repo, service, ui
here we link them then run ui
we decide what type of repository to use
we shouldn't have to change anything else besides start to choose the repository

tests and specifications for non-ui / functionality module for the first functionality

have 10 elements generated randomly
when using file repositories, if we already have 10 elements in the file, generate elements only if list is empty

eu: problem 1
